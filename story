**story**
MCChey was walking home from school when she passed by a store selling a ChinaDoll for a single dollar.
She was delighted she could purchase the ChinaDoll as it looked like it was waving the peace sign to her, with two fingers in the winds.
MCChey would happily get the ChinaDoll and walk home, exicted to show it off to her parents. 
 
 MCChey went down to the basement to play with the ChinaDoll for hours before her parents called her up for dinner.
 MCChey went upstairs to dinner and went to sleep, however she could not sleep.
 She kept hearing a voice in her dreams stating. "China Doll, China Doll up the stairs, hina Doll, China Doll up the stairs, China Doll, China Doll in your parents room."

 MCChey was scared but didnt much of it and went back to sleep.
 In the morning when she woke up she and her brother found out her parents had died.
 MCChey let out a wild scream and her brother called the police.
